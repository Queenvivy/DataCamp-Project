    "|------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| `track_id` | The Spotify ID number of the track. |\n",
    "| `artists` | Names of the artists who performed the track, separated by a `;` if there's more than one.|\n",
    "| `album_name` | The name of the album that includes the track.|\n",
    "| `track_name` | The name of the track.|\n",
    "| `popularity` | Numerical value ranges from `0` to `100`, with `100` being the highest popularity. This is calculated based on the number of times the track has been played recently, with more recent plays contributing more to the score. Duplicate tracks are scored independently.|\n",
    "| `duration_min` | The length of the track, measured in minutes.|\n",
    "| `explicit` | Indicates whether the track contains explicit lyrics. `true` means it does, `false` means it does not or it's unknown.|\n",
    "| `danceability` | A score ranges between `0.0` and `1.0` that represents the track's suitability for dancing. This is calculated by algorithm and is determined by factors like tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and regularity.|\n",
    "| `energy` | A score ranges between `0.0` and `1.0` indicating the track's intensity and activity level. Energetic tracks tend to be fast, loud, and noisy.|\n",
    "| `key` | The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch class notation. E.g.`0 = C`, `1 = C♯/D♭`, `2 = D`, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is `-1`.| \n",
    "| `loudness` | The overall loudness, measured in decibels (dB).|\n",
    "| `mode` |  The modality of a track, represented as `1` for major and `0` for minor.| \n",
    "| `speechiness` | Measures the amount of spoken words in a track. A value close to `1.0` denotes speech-based content, while `0.33` to `0.66` indicates a mix of speech and music like rap. Values below `0.33` are usually music and non-speech tracks.| \n",
    "| `acousticness` | A confidence measure ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`, with `1.0` representing the highest confidence that the track is acoustic.|\n",
    "| `instrumentalness` | Instrumentalness estimates the likelihood of a track being instrumental. Non-lyrical sounds such as \"ooh\" and \"aah\" are considered instrumental, whereas rap or spoken word tracks are classified as \"vocal\". A value closer to `1.0` indicates a higher probability that the track lacks vocal content.|\n",
    "| `liveness` | A measure of the probability that the track was performed live. Scores above `0.8` indicate a high likelihood of the track being live.|\n",
    "| `valence` | A score from `0.0` to `1.0` representing the track's positiveness. High scores suggest a more positive or happier track.|\n",
    "| `tempo` | The track's estimated tempo, measured in beats per minute (BPM).|\n",
    "| `time_signature` | An estimate of the track's time signature (meter), which is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from `3` to `7` indicating time signatures of `3/4`, to `7/4`.|\n",
    "| `track_genre` |  The genre of the track.|\n"
